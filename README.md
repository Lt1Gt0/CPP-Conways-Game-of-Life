# CPP-Conways-Game-of-Life
Recreation of Conways game of life using a very basic understanding of C++ and SFML

I am using Visual studio preview 2022 to run and edit the code
You will need to install CMake
Make sure that MinGW is installed
The version of SFML is the 32 bit version which is saved in the 'GL' File as well as the 64 bit version in the case that SFML wont work, if so unzip the 64 bit version and rename the file to SFML and replace the current one saved in 'GL'
